# Emoticon Keyboard
Most of my projects start with an impulse of some kind. Two years ago I decided I liked emoticons so much that I was going to make a keyboard just for emoticons. Although I could just have used another keyboard with a bunch of macros I was feeling ambitious and wanted to build it all by hand from the ground up. 

My process went (roughly) like this:
+ Research into what materials I need.
+ How to program the teensy to write emoticons such as “【・_・?】” (this was the hardest part)
+ Write the teensy code and client code.
+ Once that worked, I made the plate for the Cherry MX keys to fit. There were many complications to this part including how to convert 3D types in Maya, Plastic warping, and getting the keys to fit into the rough print from the school printer. 
+ From there I worked on the frame and acrylic panel which took multiple tries within itself.
+ I am now currently hand-wiring the matrix keys and lights into the teensy.
+ At NYU I hope to be able to print the keycaps in order to finish my project (a replicator 2 does not have the detail I need).
